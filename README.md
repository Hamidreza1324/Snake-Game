## Overview
A **Python-based Snake game** created using the **Turtle graphics module**.  
This project applies **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles and demonstrates game loop logic, collision detection, and class-based architecture.

The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow, and must avoid colliding with the walls or itself.

---

## Features
- Smooth snake movement with arrow key controls  
- Random food spawning on the screen  
- Score increases each time the snake eats food  
- Snake grows with each meal  
- Game over detection for wall or tail collisions  
- Clean and modular code using OOP principles  

---

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed before running the game:

- **Python 3.10 or higher** (recommended: Python 3.12)  
- **Turtle module** (included by default with Python)  
- Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** systems

## Installation
Open terminal (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamidreza1324/Snake-Game.git
cd Snake-Game

# Linux/Mac:
python3 main.py

# Windows:
python main.py 
```
